 Are you destined to be a millionaire? Will this dystopian nightmare ever end? Ask the [Magic Eight Ball](https://cassiopeian.github.io/magic-eight-ball/)!

## Features

 Once you’ve “etched” your question and selected a dial, the Magic Eight Ball will jiggle slightly, before revealing a sage response.

## Favicon

 This project pays homage to popular vintage toys, so the favicon was styled to look a bit dated. With its acid wash texture and bright neon colors, any ’80s kid would approve.

## Inspiration

 <img src="images/read-me/cc-magic-eight-ball.png" style="width: 75%">

 Codecademy has a Magic Eight Ball project that prompts users to:
 + define variables
 + create ternary expressions
 + use string interpolation within a `console.log` statement
 + generate random numbers, using the `Math.random()` method
 + utilize an `if/else` or a `switch` statement, to create a control flow

 I expanded the scope of the assignment, beyond the console, and designed an Etch A Sketch input and a two-sided eight ball for the output. To round out the retro toy theme, I also created a grungy Rubik’s Cube pattern for the background.

## Tech Specs

 Magic Eight Ball was built with jQuery version 3.4.1.
